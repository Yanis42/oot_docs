Infinite Sword Glitch
========================

The "Infinite Sword Glitch", or "ISG" for short, is a glitch where you do a crouch stab and have some kind of interaction with something else.

This glitch is used to prevent Link from falling, it is useful to achieve `Hovering`_, a glitch that allows one to be stuck in the air.

How to perform
-----------------

To get an ISG you need to hold the shield button (usually ``R``), press ``B`` to do a "crouch stab", then you need a way to interact with something.
Usually, we are using a textbox, for instance talking to Navi or any NPC, you can also use Bombs or Bombchus (or Bombflowers).

Another way to get the ISG is to jumpslash, get 0 hearts in the air, jumpslashing then getting a Recovery Heart to avoid the game over.
This is the only known method to ISG on Ocarina of Time 3D.
