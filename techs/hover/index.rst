Hover/Hovering
========================

Hovering (or hover for short) is a trick where you shield a damage in the air while having the `Infinite Sword Glitch`_.

.. _Infinite Sword Glitch: ../isg/index.html

How to perform
-----------------

First, you need to `get an ISG`_. Next, you need to do a backflip or a sidehop (or any kind of movement that gets you in the air with an ISG),
then you need to hold target (usually ``Z``) and hold shield (usually ``R``) and get a damage source to hit the shield.
This source can come from an explosion from a bomb or a bombchu for instance or it can be an enemy hitting the shield.

Once you got this setup you should be in the air, levitating. Note that using the Hover Boots can make the hovering trick easier to perform.

Link will automatically go on the ground if:

- You use the sword/deku sticks
- Get damaged
- Be too close to the ground
- Not wearing Hover Boots and be too far away from a wall
